# Welcome everyone.

Welcome to my blog posts. I am excited to get my portfolio up and running via experimenting with Next.js.

A little about me. My name is Kevin O'Malley. I live in Ravenswood, Chicago with my wife, Maria, and our two dogs, Ollie and Chloe.

I am a frontend developer experienced in JavaScript. I currently work at a global ecommerce platform provider company named cleverbridge. (Lowercase 'c' is how they go by). I have been working there for more than three and a half years and I work with a great team both in Chicago and Cologne, Germany.

I enjoy tinkering with new JavaScript libraries and frameworks, as well as running through Udemy courses in my free time. I am excited to continue my path as a developer!
