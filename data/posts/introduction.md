Welcome to my blog posts. I am excited to get this project up and running via experimenting with Next.js.

A little about me. My name is Kevin O'Malley. I live in Ravenswood, Chicago with my wife, Maria, and our two dogs, Ollie and Chloe. Here are pictures of them both because who doesn't love pictures of dogs. Ollie is in desperate need of a haircut at this moment.

I am a frontend developer experienced in JavaScript. I currently work at a global ecommerce platform provider company named cleverbridge. (Lowercase 'c' is how they go by). I have been working there for more than three and a half years and I work with a great team both in Chicago and Cologne, Germany.

In my free time, I will regularly be running through some Udemy course, whether it incoporates GraphQL, Git, Next.js, Node, Gatsby, and so on. I really enjoy continually learning, as well as following though a course to build a project with a new technology, then tinker and customize it with my own exploration.
