Welcome to my blog posts. I am excited to get this project up and running via experimenting with Next.js.

A little about me. My name is Kevin O'Malley. I lived in Chicago for the past eight years but just recently moved to Dayton, Ohio with my wife, Maria, and our two dogs, Ollie and Chloe. Here are pictures of them both because who doesn't love pictures of dogs. Ollie is in desperate need of a haircut at this moment.

I am a full stack software engineer experienced in JavaScript. Prior to being a developer, I had a bit of a wild ride in careers. I started out with working in the field of Autism as a behavior therapist. I did this for several years, both in Colorado and Chicago. I then moved out of behavior therapy and did contract work and part time opportunites while I figured out my next career path. One of my favorite part time jobs at this time was working at the Christkindl Market in downtown Chicago for a winter. I worked at a glass blowing booth and sold ornaments with German colleagues.

Eventually I joined a sales representative incubator that recruited and trained sales reps for hiring companies. Although this opportunity didn't quite fullfill what I was looking for, in a small twist of fate, I discovered the Fullstack Academy bootcamp was taking in students in Chicago. I decided to leave my sales rep position and study JavaScript development full time.

After two months, and attending Fullstack Academy nightly beginner's classes, I felt that I was ready for the real thing. I submitted my application to Fullstack, was interviewed, and passed the coding assessment. A few weeks later, I got my acceptance letter to begin classes in the fall.

I had a fantastic time at Fullstack Academy, and even stayed on for another two semesters as a Teaching Fellow. Once that position ended, I immediately jumped into the e-commerce platform provider, cleverbridge, as a frontend developer.

Finally, I recently joined a startup company named Crowdpurr, where we develop an audience experience platform. I am very excited with where I am right now, and feel very fortunate with how life has lead me to where I am.

In my free time, I will regularly be running through some Udemy course, whether it incoporates GraphQL, Git, Next.js, Node, Gatsby, and so on. I really enjoy continually learning, as well as following though a course to build a project with a new technology, then tinker and customize it with my own exploration.
