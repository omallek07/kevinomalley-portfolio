Description: MyBurger allows users to create an account, customize a burger, and fill out delivery information to have the burger "delivered" to their address. Their orders and user information persist in a Firebase database and users can access all of their previous orders.

Web project was instructed by Maximillian Schwarzmueller in this course: https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/v4/content

What the course focused on:

The "What", "Why" and "How" React Basics (Base features, syntax and concepts) How to output lists and conditional content Styling of React components A deep dive into the internals of React and advanced component features How to access Http content from within React apps (AJAX) Redux, Redux, Redux ... from basics to advanced! Forms and form validation in React apps Authentication An introduction to unit testing An introduction to Next.js React app deployment instructions ...and much more!

A special note: I did this project back while I was attending fullstack academy. At this point of time, there was no useState or useEffect in existence, and high level component lifecycles ruled the world. It is funny how quickly our technology changes in a few years!
