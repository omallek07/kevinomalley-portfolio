# Documentation Tool

Our team had a pain point of lacking a proper source of documentation. To help solve this, I developed a GUI tool using Gatsby.js that allows my team to upload markdown text and to search and find existing documentation.

This tool uses [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), [Ant Design Library](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce), and the Gitlab API for version control.
