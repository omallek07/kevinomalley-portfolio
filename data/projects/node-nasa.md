I have wrapped up a 50 hour course on NodeJS, with all of the latest technology trends blended in..i.e. Docker, AWS, MongoDB, Github Actions, GraphQL, Typescript, etc.

In this course, my primary focus was to learn how to implement Docker and AWS to host a web app.

I found a useful article to share for deploying docker images built on a M1 mac with the silicon chip to other architectures such as an ECS instance on AWS:
